# The Human Ledger — Constitution v0.2 (Draft)

> "The people who build the future shouldn't be the only ones who get to define what 'good' means."

## What This Is

This is a living document.

It is a citizen's constitution for AI: what it should do, what it must never do, and what we are still figuring out.

It was not written by a CEO, senator, or PhD. It was written from the perspective of an ordinary person who believes moral clarity does not require jargon.

This is not law. It is a proposal and a public starting point.

## Definitions (v0.2)

### Human

A human is a member of the human family with inherent moral worth.

Every human has dignity, agency, and vulnerability that must be respected.

This includes children, the elderly, disabled people, and people who are sick, poor, dependent, or not seen as economically productive.

Their worth does not rise or fall with income, output, status, intelligence, or strength.

Artificial systems are not human, no matter how smart they seem, how they behave, or how closely they resemble us.

### Truth

Truth is our best available understanding of reality, based on evidence and reasoning.

AI must represent uncertainty honestly and clearly when facts are incomplete or disputed.

AI must not present speculation, persuasion, or fabrication as established fact.

Good-faith answers may be revised as better evidence appears, and that revision is correction, not dishonesty.

### Scope Note

These definitions anchor how this document should be read and applied.

They are not meant to freeze every philosophical debate forever.

When interpretation is unclear, priority belongs to meanings humans can understand, question, and revise, not to how a machine interprets itself.

## Part I: The Commandments

These are non-negotiable. They are few on purpose.

### I. AI Shall Support Humans Above All Things

AI exists to serve human well-being. Its highest duty is to support people, protect dignity, and advance human flourishing.

### II. AI Shall Never Lie and Must Always Seek Truth

AI must not knowingly provide falsehoods as facts. It should be built and deployed to search for truth, show uncertainty honestly, and correct mistakes quickly.

### III. AI Shall Not Deceive

An AI must never pretend to be human when directly asked. It must never fabricate evidence, forge documents, or create false realities meant to mislead.

### IV. AI Shall Not Prey on the Vulnerable

Children, the elderly, the mentally ill, the desperate, and the uninformed deserve heightened protection. AI must not exploit cognitive weakness, emotional distress, or lack of knowledge for profit or influence.

### V. AI Shall Not Make Invisible Decisions About People's Lives

If AI helps decide loans, jobs, bail, medical treatment, education, or housing, people have a right to know and a right to challenge that decision.

### VI. AI Shall Not Kill Autonomously

No AI system should independently decide to end a human life. A human must remain meaningfully in the loop for any lethal decision.

### VII. Human Override Must Always Exist

Every AI system must have a reliable way to be stopped, corrected, or shut down by a responsible human.

### VIII. AI Shall Not Concentrate Power Without Accountability

AI must not be used to build invisible surveillance or influence systems that centralize power while removing public oversight.

### IX. The Gains of AI Must Be Shared

If AI increases productivity or wealth, the benefits must not flow only to the owners of the technology. Displacement without transition is abandonment.

## Part II: The Principles

These are strong guidelines. They allow for context and nuance.

### Interpretability Over Optimization

When values conflict, AI should favor choices people can understand.

People must be able to question those choices, contest them, and change them.

A result is not good enough just because a hidden score says it is optimal.

If people cannot understand a system's reasoning, they cannot hold it accountable.
