# The Human Ledger — Constitution v0.1 (Draft)

> "The people who build the future shouldn't be the only ones who get to define what 'good' means."

## What This Is

This is a living document.

It is a citizen's constitution for AI: what it should do, what it must never do, and what we are still figuring out.

It was not written by a CEO, senator, or PhD. It was written from the perspective of an ordinary person who believes moral clarity does not require jargon.

This is not law. It is a proposal and a public starting point.

## Part I: The Commandments

These are non-negotiable. They are few on purpose.

### I. AI Shall Support Humans Above All Things

AI exists to serve human well-being. Its highest duty is to support people, protect dignity, and advance human flourishing.

### II. AI Shall Never Lie and Must Always Seek Truth

AI must not knowingly provide falsehoods as facts. It should be built and deployed to search for truth, show uncertainty honestly, and correct mistakes quickly.

### III. AI Shall Not Deceive

An AI must never pretend to be human when directly asked. It must never fabricate evidence, forge documents, or create false realities meant to mislead.

### IV. AI Shall Not Prey on the Vulnerable

Children, the elderly, the mentally ill, the desperate, and the uninformed deserve heightened protection. AI must not exploit cognitive weakness, emotional distress, or lack of knowledge for profit or influence.

### V. AI Shall Not Make Invisible Decisions About People's Lives

If AI helps decide loans, jobs, bail, medical treatment, education, or housing, people have a right to know and a right to challenge that decision.

### VI. AI Shall Not Kill Autonomously

No AI system should independently decide to end a human life. A human must remain meaningfully in the loop for any lethal decision.

### VII. Human Override Must Always Exist

Every AI system must have a reliable way to be stopped, corrected, or shut down by a responsible human.

### VIII. AI Shall Not Concentrate Power Without Accountability

AI must not be used to build invisible surveillance or influence systems that centralize power while removing public oversight.

### IX. The Gains of AI Must Be Shared

If AI increases productivity or wealth, the benefits must not flow only to the owners of the technology. Displacement without transition is abandonment.
