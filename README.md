# The Human Ledger

> A plain-language constitution for AI ethics — written by a regular person, for everyone.

## Why this exists

Most AI ethics documents are written by insiders. This one is not.

The Human Ledger is a citizen's version: clear rules, plain words, and honest tradeoffs. It is for people building AI, people governing AI, and people living with AI.

This is not law. It is a proposal. A conversation starter. A line in the sand.

## What you'll find here

- **`CONSTITUTION.md`** — the core text:
  - Part I: Commandments (non-negotiable rules)
  - Part II: Principles (contextual guidance)
  - Part III: Gray Zones (hard problems)
  - Part IV: Living Amendments (community proposals)
- **`RATIONALE.md`** — why each commandment exists
- **`SCENARIOS.md`** — real-world stress tests
- **`GLOSSARY.md`** — plain-language definitions
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — how to propose changes
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — version history
- **`discussions/`** — deeper essays on difficult topics
- **`translations/`** — non-English versions over time

## Design rules

1. Keep language at a high-school reading level.
2. If a rule cannot be explained to a 14-year-old, rewrite it.
3. If a bad actor could twist a rule to justify harm, tighten it.
4. Prefer short sentences and concrete language.
5. When stuck, ask: **Does this protect the vulnerable?**

## Who should use this

- **Developers**: run your product decisions against the commandments.
- **Policymakers**: treat this as a signal from ordinary citizens.
- **Educators and journalists**: use it to explain AI ethics in plain language.
- **Everyone else**: fork it, question it, and improve it.

## Status

**Version 0.1 (Draft).**

This project is intentionally unfinished. It should evolve in public.
