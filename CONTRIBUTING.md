# Contributing to The Human Ledger

Thanks for being here.

You do not need to be technical to contribute. Clear thinking and lived experience are enough.

## What you can contribute

- Edits that improve clarity
- New principles or amendments
- Real-world scenarios that expose weak spots
- Translations into other languages
- Short essays for `discussions/`

## Ground rules

1. Use plain language.
2. Explain your reasoning.
3. Focus on protecting vulnerable people.
4. Avoid personal attacks.
5. Be open to revision.

## How to propose an amendment

1. Open an issue with this template:
   - **Proposed text**
   - **Problem it solves**
   - **Possible misuse or abuse**
   - **Who benefits / who might be harmed**
2. Start with small, testable wording.
3. Link to examples or scenarios where possible.

## Review standard

A good proposal should pass:

- **Grandma test:** understandable to a non-expert
- **Dictator test:** hard to twist for harm
- **Vulnerable-first test:** protects those at greatest risk

## Code of collaboration

Assume good intent. Be direct, but respectful. This project is a public learning process.
