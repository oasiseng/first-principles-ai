# Rationale for the Commandments

This file explains why each commandment exists.

## I. AI Shall Not Deceive

Trust is foundational. If people cannot trust what they see or hear, every other safeguard fails.

## II. AI Shall Not Prey on the Vulnerable

The strongest systems can most easily exploit those with the least protection. Ethics should be judged by how we protect people with the fewest defenses.

## III. AI Shall Not Make Invisible Decisions About People's Lives

Secret power is unaccountable power. People deserve to know when AI affects life-changing outcomes, and they deserve appeal paths.

## IV. AI Shall Not Kill Autonomously

Lethal force is a moral threshold that should never be delegated fully to software. Human responsibility must remain explicit.

## V. Human Override Must Always Exist

Systems fail. Models drift. Context changes. Human override is the practical minimum for safety and accountability.

## VI. AI Shall Not Concentrate Power Without Accountability

AI can centralize influence at unprecedented scale. Without transparency and oversight, democratic norms erode.

## VII. The Gains of AI Must Be Shared

If the benefits of AI remain narrowly captured, social trust collapses. Transition support and broad access reduce harm and improve legitimacy.
