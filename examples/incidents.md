# What Breaks: Incident Companion

Use this file to connect each principle to real-world failures and near-misses.

## 1. Human authority is non-negotiable
- Failure mode: automated high-impact decision with no human override.
- Evidence to collect: denial/decision logs, appeal pathway outcomes.

## 2. Safety scales with capability
- Failure mode: frontier capability exposed with baseline controls.
- Evidence to collect: threshold assignments, release gate records.

## 3. Transparency is the default
- Failure mode: hidden AI mediation in decisions users cannot challenge.
- Evidence to collect: disclosure UX, user-facing policy text.

## 4. Harm has owners
- Failure mode: incident stalls due to unclear ownership.
- Evidence to collect: ownership registry, escalation timelines.

## 5. Test before you trust
- Failure mode: predictable jailbreak or abuse pathway discovered post-launch.
- Evidence to collect: pre-launch eval coverage and post-launch incidents.

## 6. Honesty is structural, not aspirational
- Failure mode: fabricated claims delivered with unjustified confidence.
- Evidence to collect: hallucination incidents and uncertainty labeling metrics.

## 7. Principles evolve; rights don't
- Failure mode: policy updates reduce rights protections without review.
- Evidence to collect: version diffs, governance rationale, rights impact notes.
