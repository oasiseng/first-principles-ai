# Mapping to NIST AI RMF

- Human authority is non-negotiable -> GOVERN roles/oversight outcomes.
- Safety scales with capability -> MAP/MEASURE risk characterization by capability tier.
- Transparency is the default -> MAP communication of context and limitations.
- Harm has owners -> GOVERN accountability and risk ownership.
- Test before you trust -> MEASURE evaluation and MANAGE response.
- Honesty is structural -> MANAGE trustworthiness and misuse mitigation.
- Principles evolve; rights don't -> GOVERN lifecycle improvement.
