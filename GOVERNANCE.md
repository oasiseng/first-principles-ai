# Governance

## Purpose

This project maintains vendor-neutral AI safety principles through transparent, community review.

## Decision model

- Changes are proposed through RFCs in GitHub Discussions.
- Standard review window: 14 days.
- Maintainers decide after review and publish rationale.
- Major changes require explicit mapping updates in `/mappings` and checklist impact notes.

## Versioning policy

Semantic versioning is required:

- **MAJOR**: add/remove principles or redefine core constraints.
- **MINOR**: clarify language, add mappings/examples, improve implementation guidance.
- **PATCH**: typo, formatting, or non-substantive fixes.

## Roles

- **Maintainers**: steward quality, merge approved updates, publish release notes.
- **Contributors**: propose RFCs, improve mappings/templates/examples, submit corrections.
- **Reviewers**: provide evidence-based feedback and identify safety regressions.

## Non-negotiable constraints

Any accepted change must preserve human rights constraints: privacy, dignity, autonomy, and non-discrimination.
