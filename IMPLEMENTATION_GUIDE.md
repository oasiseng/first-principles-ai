# Implementation Guide

This guide translates each principle into controls, artifacts, and operating routines.

## 1. Human authority is non-negotiable
- Required controls: override capability, appeals process, high-impact human review gates.
- Artifacts: override runbook, decision appeal SOP, ownership matrix.
- Minimum cadence: quarterly override drills.

## 2. Safety scales with capability
- Required controls: capability taxonomy, threshold triggers, tiered safeguards.
- Artifacts: threshold register, risk-tier matrix, release gate checklist.
- Minimum cadence: threshold review for each major model release.

## 3. Transparency is the default
- Required controls: user disclosure, explainability boundary statements, model limit notices.
- Artifacts: disclosure text library, explanation template, known-limits page.
- Minimum cadence: review all disclosures every release cycle.

## 4. Harm has owners
- Required controls: named owner, delegated incident commander, escalation path.
- Artifacts: ownership directory, on-call policy, incident contacts.
- Minimum cadence: owner verification monthly.

## 5. Test before you trust
- Required controls: pre-deployment safety eval suite, red-team tests, production monitoring.
- Artifacts: eval reports, pass/fail thresholds, drift alerts.
- Minimum cadence: evaluate before release and continuously post-release.

## 6. Honesty is structural, not aspirational
- Required controls: uncertainty signaling, anti-deception policies, traceable evidence references.
- Artifacts: confidence rubric, refusal policy, citation patterns.
- Minimum cadence: monthly sampling for misrepresentation risk.

## 7. Principles evolve; rights don't
- Required controls: semantic versioning, RFC process, human-rights impact checks.
- Artifacts: version policy, governance log, rights constraints checklist.
- Minimum cadence: governance review each minor/major release.
